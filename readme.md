# trio-asyncgpio-demo

The two main files are:

    trio_asyncgpio_demo.py
    trio_asyncgpio_demo.rst

Check the rst file for documentation related to how the demo works.

There is another file:

    asyncgpio_shutdown.py

This is close enough to trio_asyncgpio_demo that there is not separate documentation. The main difference is that this version separates shutdown into a separate class (ShutdownManager).
